## Acknowledgements
Sincere thanks go to Andrew Davis who served as my project supervisor. He provided his time outside of lessons to give advice throughout my year and was extremely fundamental in helping me understand the approches to problems in the project.

Also to the many students and teachers who help make the competition a success every year. The competition would not continue to have it's legacy without generous people putting their money to help local, national, and international charities.
